**2012/01/04** - New beta-1.1 release in the downloads section (or you can check it out in the tags folder of the repository). This release now supports Castalia 3.2. Some bug fixes have been performed and new statistics, based on signals, can optionally be used instead of the old method (that is still there).
I would like to thank Jon Szymaniak and Athanassios Boulis for their contribution.
